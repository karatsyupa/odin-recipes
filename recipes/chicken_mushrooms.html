    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breast halves, boneless, skin on</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>Â½ cup water </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat ovent to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season chicken on all sides with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in an ovenproof skillet. Place chicken skin-side down in skillet and
            cook until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn chicken over; stir mushrooms with a pinch of salt into skillet. Increase heat to high; cook, stirring
            mushrooms occasionally, until mushrooms shrink slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices
            run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F
            (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken breasts to a plate and loosely tent with foil; set aside.</li>
        <li>Set skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat; cook and stir mushrooms until brown bits start to form on
            the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Pour water into the skillet, and bring to a boil while scraping the
            browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. Cook until water is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from
            heat</li>
        <li>Stir in any accumulated juices from the chicken into the skillet. Stir butter into mushroom mixture,
            stirring constantly until butter is completely melted and incorporated.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper. Spoon mushroom sauce over chicken and serve.</li>
    </ol>
